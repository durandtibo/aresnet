    """Perform an HTTP request with automatic retry logic.

    This function implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for
    handling transient HTTP errors. It attempts the request up to max_retries + 1
    times, waiting progressively longer between each retry.

    The retry logic handles three types of failures:
    1. Retryable HTTP status codes (e.g., 429, 500, 502, 503, 504)
    2. Timeout exceptions (httpx.TimeoutException)
    3. General network errors (httpx.RequestError)

    Backoff Strategy:
    - Exponential backoff: backoff_factor * (2 ** attempt)
    - Jitter: Optional randomization added to prevent thundering herd
    - Retry-After header: If present in the response (429/503), the server's
      suggested wait time is used instead of exponential backoff

    Args:
        url: The URL to send the request to.
        method: The HTTP method name (e.g., "GET", "POST") for logging.
        request_func: The function to call to make the request (e.g.,
            client.get, client.post).
        max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts for failed requests.
            Must be >= 0.
        backoff_factor: Factor for exponential backoff between retries. The wait
            time is calculated as: backoff_factor * (2 ** attempt) seconds,
            where attempt is 0-indexed (0, 1, 2, ...).
        status_forcelist: Tuple of HTTP status codes that should trigger a retry.
        jitter_factor: Factor for adding random jitter to backoff delays. The jitter
            is calculated as: random.uniform(0, jitter_factor) * base_sleep_time,
            and this jitter is ADDED to the base sleep time. Set to 0 to disable
            jitter (default). Recommended value is 0.1 for 10% jitter to prevent
            thundering herd issues.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the request function.

    Returns:
        An httpx.Response object containing the server's HTTP response.

    Raises:
        HttpRequestError: If the request times out, encounters network errors,
            or fails after exhausting all retries.

    Example:
        ```pycon
        >>> import httpx
        >>> from aresnet import request_with_automatic_retry
        >>> with httpx.Client() as client:

        ...         backoff_factor=1.0,
        ...         jitter_factor=0.1,  # Add 10% jitter
        ...     )  # doctest: +SKIP
